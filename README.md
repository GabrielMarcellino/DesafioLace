## Proof of concept
- Two tests were made to make sure it was possible to implement the comunication and determine it's operation parameters.
* The first - UDPClientTest - implemented transmission;
* The second - UDPServerTest - implemented reception.
##ChatPrompt
* ChatPrompt is the final version with both proofs of concept merged and added features for user interface and error management.
